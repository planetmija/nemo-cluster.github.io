# Acknowledgement

When preparing a publication describing work that involved the usage of a bwForCluster,
e.g. the *bwForCluster NEMO*, please ensure that you reference the bwHPC initiative,
the bwHPC project and – if appropriate – also the bwHPC facility itself. Such recognition
is important for acquiring funding for the next generation hardware, support services,
data storage and infrastructure.

The following sample text is suggested to acknowledge the usage of the *bwForCluster NEMO* for your scientific publication:

    The authors acknowledge support by the state of Baden-Württemberg through bwHPC
    and the German Research Foundation (DFG) through grant no INST 39/963-1 FUGG (bwForCluster NEMO).

In addition, we kindly ask you to notify us of any reports, conference papers, journal articles,
theses, posters, talks which contain results obtained on any bwHPC resource by sending an email to
