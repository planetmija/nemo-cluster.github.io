# bwForCluster NEMO

The bwForCluster NEMO is a high-performance compute resource with high speed interconnect.
It is intended for compute activities related to research in for researchers from the fields
**N**euroscience, **E**lementary Particle Physics, **M**icrosystems Engineering and **M**aterial Sciences (**NEMO**).

For a detailed NEMO documentation refer to the
[NEMO Wiki](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO).

## Software and Operating System

- Operating System: [CentOS 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CentOS) (similar to RHEL 7)
- Queuing System: [MOAB/Torque](http://docs.adaptivecomputing.com/9-1-3/suite/help.htm) (see
[Batch Jobs](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Moab)
- (Scientific) Libraries and Software: [Environment Modules](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Environment_Modules)

## Compute Nodes

For researchers from the scientific fields
**N**euroscience, **E**lementary Particle Physics, **M**icrosystems Engineering and **M**aterial Sciences
the bwForCluster **NEMO** offers 900
[compute nodes](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#Compute_and_Special_Purpose_Nodes)
plus several special purpose nodes for login, interactive jobs, etc.

### Special Purpose Nodes

Besides the classical compute node several
[nodes](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#Compute_and_Special_Purpose_Nodes)
serve as login and preprocessing nodes, nodes for interactive jobs, visualization nodes
and nodes for creating virtual environments providing a virtual service environment.

## Storage Architecture

The bwForCluster NEMO consists of two separate
[storage systems](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#Storage_Architecture),
one for the userâ€™s
[home directory](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/#.24HOME)
`$HOME` and one serving
[workspaces](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#Workspaces)
The home directory is limited in space and parallel access but offers
snapshots of your files and Backup. The workspace is a parallel file
system which offers fast and parallel file access and a bigger capacity
than the home directory. This storage is based on
[BeeGFS](http://www.beegfs.com)
and can be accessed parallel from many nodes. Additionally, each compute
node provides high-speed temporary storage on the node-local
[solid state disk](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#Local_Disk_Space_.24TMPDIR)
(SSD) via the `$TMPDIR` environment variable.

## High Performance Network

The compute nodes all are interconnected through the
[high performance network](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/NEMO/Hardware#High_Performance_Network)
Omni-Path which offers a very small latency and
100 Gbit/s throughput. The parallel storage for the workspaces is
attached via Omni-Path to all cluster nodes. For non-blocking
communication 20 islands with 44 nodes and 880 cores each are available.
The islands are connected with a blocking factor of 1:11 (or 400 Gbit/s
for 44 nodes).
