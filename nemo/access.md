# Access to NEMO

For access to NEMO, you'll need a bwForCluster entitlement (legal
requirement) an associated Rechenvorhaben and the registration to the
NEMO service.


## Registration Process (short version)

The registration process consists of 4 steps. The first two steps can be
done in parallel:
