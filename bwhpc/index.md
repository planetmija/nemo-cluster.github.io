# The bwHPC Project

The state of Baden-Württemberg offers many
[HPC resources](http://www.bwhpc.de){:target="_blank"}
in the state. For example the
[bwHPC clusters](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwHPC_Cluster){:target="_blank"}
(bwForClusters, bwUniCluster) at the entry level are available for
researchers and students from the state of Baden-Württemberg. They run a
wide range of Open Source and commercial software packages. Researchers
with a very high demand in computing resources can use clusters and
supercomputers at higher levels.

The
[bwForClusters](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwForCluster){:target="_blank"}
are for researchers in selected research fields.
The
[bwForCluster NEMO](/nemo/)
in Freiburg is available for researchers of the scientific
communities: **N**euroscience, **E**lementary Particle Physics,
**M**icrosystems Engineering and **M**aterial Science. The
[bwUniCluster](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwUniCluster){:target="_blank"}
is available for all researchers and students from the state of BW.

All available
[bwHPC clusters](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwHPC_Cluster){:target="_blank"}
including access, hardware, software configuration are described in the
[central wiki](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
as well. Here you can find the information about the installed software
and how to
[run batch jobs](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Batch_Jobs){:target="_blank"}
on the clusters.

The
[bwHPC clusters](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwHPC_Cluster){:target="_blank"}
use the
[module environment system](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Software_Modules){:target="_blank"}
This means that you\'ll have to load the correct module first to have a
software installation available on the cluster.

We provide
[help](https://www.bwhpc.de/support.html){:target="_blank"}
for the technical side of the clusters and for the software packages as
well. But because our resources are limited we can only give some hints
and can\'t give ready solutions. We expect that users first try to solve
their problems within a research group and use the material they can
find in the wiki and in other documentations. We are not experts in all
the software which is available on the clusters, so we would have to
route these questions to other experts, as well. But there is the
possibility to call for tiger team support on a regular basis, e.g.
parallelization of code. This will be announced on the central web site
and the newsletter.

The
[bwHPC-S5 project](http://www.bwhpc.de){:target="_blank"}
offers
[regular courses](https://www.bwhpc.de/courses_a_tutorials.html){:target="_blank"}
throughout the state of Baden-Württemberg featuring introductions and
advanced topics for using the
[bwHPC clusters](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Category:BwHPC_Cluster){:target="_blank"}
If you would like to have a course you can\'t find on the course list,
please send us a request for that and who is interested in which topics.
We can then try to provide this course at one site.

A prerequisite for support is the use of our ticket system
(see [contact](/privacy-policy/))
instead of personal messages. Otherwise individual requests might be lost and can
not be tracked by other team members. We encourage the use of the
official university email address clearly stating your affiliation
(\<e-mail-ID@\<name-of-uni\>.de), because we receive mails from the
whole state. For Freiburg users this can be set via preferred e-mail though
[myaccount](https://myaccount.uni-freiburg.de){:target="_blank"}.

We publish news and other important information on our
newsletter and [news](/news/) page.
