#   We had to restart the BeeGFS services today to make the final configuration changes.
#   Hopefully this adjustment solves the problems we've had over the last couple of days.
#   Unfortunately, not all jobs seem to have survived the restart
#   (although IO is waiting for the services to return).
#   We're sorry about that.
#   If you are still having problems, please contact us.

#   Sporadic dropouts in communication with the application page for computing projects.
#   The project name "bwYYzNNNN" is used for secondary groups in NEMO.

#   * Login to NEMO fails with a notice to log in to the registration server.
#   <br />
#   * The registration server indicates that a requirement for the service NEMO is missing.
#   <br />
#   * Access to workspaces where the secondary group is used to allow access (ACL, setfacl).
#   <br />
