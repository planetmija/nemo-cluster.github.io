# title: Sporadic problems witch secondary groups
# text: >
#   Sporadic dropouts in communication with the application page for computing projects.
#   The project name "bwYYzNNNN" is used for secondary groups in NEMO.
#   Problems which can occur:
#   <br />
#   * Login to NEMO fails with a notice to log in to the registration server.
#   <br />
#   * The registration server indicates that a requirement for the service NEMO is missing.
#   <br />
#   * Access to workspaces where the secondary group is used to allow access (ACL, setfacl).
#   <br />
#   We are working on the problem.
