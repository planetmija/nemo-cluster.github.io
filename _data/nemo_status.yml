# title: Sporadic problems witch secondary groups
# text: >
#   Sporadic dropouts in communication with the application page for computing projects.
#   The project name "bwYYzNNNN" is used for secondary groups in NEMO.
#   Problems which can occur:
#   <br />
#   * Login to NEMO fails with a notice to log in to the registration server.
#   <br />
#   * The registration server indicates that a requirement for the service NEMO is missing.
#   <br />
#   * Access to workspaces where the secondary group is used to allow access (ACL, setfacl).
#   <br />
#   We are working on the problem.

# title: Scheduled High Performance Network Maintenance 08.08.2022
# text: >
#   We need to reboot all Omni-Path switches and replace some cables.
#   Since the workspaces and MPI jobs depend on OPA, the entire cluster will be shut down for a few hours.
#   <br />
#   <br />
#   <strong>Date: 08.08.2022 8:00 - 18:00 CEST</strong>
#   <br />
#   <br />
#   The entire NEMO cluster will be shut down.
#   No computations are possible during maintenance, so submit all jobs on time.
#   Note that only jobs whose walltime fits within the time window until maintenance can be started.
#   Jobs that cannot be started will be processed afterwards.
#   However, if problems occur, the queue may need to be emptied.
#   During maintenance, the operating system of the cluster is updated.
