# title: Singularity is only supported in version 3.8.
# text: >
#   Since GO had a security-critical vulnerability, we had to recompile Singularity.
#   All older versions are thus disabled as of today.
#   If you have problems with the new version, please contact us.

title: NEMO Filesystem Quota
author: HPC Team Freiburg
date: 2022-04-04
text: >
  In the past we often had questions about the quota of the HOME directory and the workspaces.
  Since this is not easy to find out for HOME, we have created a small script that shows the quota for HOME and the workspaces.
  Just run <code>nemoquota</code> on any NEMO node.
