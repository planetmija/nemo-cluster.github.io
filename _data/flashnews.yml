title: Singularity is only supported in version 3.11.
text: >
  Since Singularity had a security-critical vulnerability, we had to install Singularity v.3.11.
  All older versions are thus disabled as of today.
  If you have problems with the new version, please contact us.

# text: >
#   We have received instructions from the University of Freiburg to save 30% of the power consumption.
#   To achieve this, we have shut down about 30% of the NEMO nodes.
#   Currently, about 625 nodes are available (~70% of all available nodes).
#   <br />
#   Update 05.10.2022: You can check the usage of your group with <code>nemorvusage</code>.

# title: Cooling System Heat Problem
# text: >
#   Due to the hot temperatures in the next days, we have to gradually reduce the load on the cooling system.
#   Therefore, we will shut down the NEMO machines in the next few days after finishing a job.
#   No jobs will be canceled (unless the cooling fails in the meantime), but the waiting times in the queue will probably increase drastically.
#   After the maintenance on 08.08. we will see how many nodes we can start up again.

# text: >
#   In the past we often had questions about the quota of the HOME directory and the workspaces.
#   Since this is not easy to find out for HOME, we have created a small script that shows the quota for HOME and the workspaces.
#   <br />
#   Just run <code>nemoquota</code> on any NEMO node.
#   <br />
#   Update 04.04.2022 17:15 CEST: To make the NEMO tools easier to find, we renamed all previous scripts that started with <code>showmy...</code> to <code>nemo...</code>.

# title: In Memoriam Rainer
# text: >
#   It is with great sadness that we have to inform you that our colleague Rainer Rutka from the University of Konstanz passed away last Friday at the age of 61.
#   Rainer was an active member and passionate supporter of the bwHPC projects and the bwForCluster NEMO.
#   We will remember him for his helpfulness and his constant efforts to pave the way to HPC for all scientists.
#   Our thoughts are with Rainer's family and friends.
