Inspection of the data center power supply.

**Date : 03.03.2022 6:00 - 18:00 CET**

The complete NEMO cluster will be shut down.
No computing is possible during the maintenance, so submit all jobs in time.
Note that only jobs whose walltime fits into the time window until maintenance can start.
Jobs that cannot start will only be processed afterwards.
However, in the event of problems, the queue may have to be emptied.
During maintenance the operating system of the cluster is updated.
