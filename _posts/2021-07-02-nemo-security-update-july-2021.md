Security update July applied (CentOS 7.9, Rev. 8) on NEMO worker nodes starting 01.07.2021 at 12:20 CEST.
The security update is applied automatically after a running job finishes.

Initially there was a problem after the update.
The local SSD wasn't mounted properly so that the RAM disk was used.
This problem was solved on 02.07. at 14:15 CEST.
