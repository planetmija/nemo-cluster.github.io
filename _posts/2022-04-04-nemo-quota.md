In the past we often had questions about the quota of the HOME directory and the workspaces.
Since this is not easy to find out for HOME, we have created a small script that shows the quota for HOME and the workspaces.

Just run `nemoquota` on any NEMO node.

Update 04.04.2022 17:15 CEST: To make the NEMO tools easier to find, we renamed all previous scripts that started with <code>showmy...</code> to <code>nemo...</code>.
