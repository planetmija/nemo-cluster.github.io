**Title: Introduction to MPI with C/C++**

**Date: 15.03.2022**

**Topic: Parallel Programming: Introduction to MPI with C/C++ on bwUniCluster 2.0** (Web Seminar)

Lecturer: Bärbel Große-Wöhrmann (HLRS)

Web: [https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_682&client_id=BWHPC](https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_682&client_id=BWHPC){:target="_blank"}

## Abstract

Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a widely-used parallel programming paradigm for distributed memory systems.
In this course we introduce basic MPI routines and run simple examples on bwUniCluster 2.0.
The target audience are newbies in MPI.
No knowledge of MPI is required.

## Agenda

- Two-sided point-to-point communication
- Collective communications
- Exercises and live demo on bwUniCluster 2.0
- Groups and communicators
- Cartesian topologies

After this course, participants will...
- have a detailed understanding of basic MPI routines,
- know how to compile and run MPI parallel C/C++ programs on bwUniCluster 2.0.

Prerequisites:
- the bwUniCluster entitlement https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster_2.0_User_Access
- some background of working on the cluster, e.g. creating simple batch scripts with an editor like nano, vi or emacs.
