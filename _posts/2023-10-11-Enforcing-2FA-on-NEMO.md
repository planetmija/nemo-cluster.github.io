**UPDATE 21.11.2023**: We will enforce 2FA logins on login2 on 29.11.2023 and on login1 11.12.2023.

**UPDATE 13.11.2023**: We will inform you in the next few days when this will be the case. We need to fix a problem first.

**UPDATE 03.11.2023**: We will enforce 2FA logins on login2 on 13.11.2023 and on login1 2 weeks later on 27.11.2023.

As previously [announced](/news/2023/08/08/Testing-2FA-on-NEMO/), we are testing 2FA for logins on NEMO.
This feature will be enforced on all login nodes on NEMO in November.
We will enforce 2FA logins on login2 on 06.11.2023 and on login1 2 weeks later on 20.11.2023.

If you want to test your login, please use vis1.nemo.uni-freiburg.de and vis2.nemo.uni-freiburg.de.
If you need a SSH login without a second factor, please contact us (Support NEMO).

Please visit [https://login.bwidm.de/user/twofa.xhtml](https://login.bwidm.de/user/twofa.xhtml){:target="_blank"} to create a new token if you don't already have one.
If you have already generated a second factor for bwUniCluster or JUSTUS2 on [https://login.bwidm.de](https://login.bwidm.de){:target="_blank"}, you are good to go.
See [https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Registration/2FA](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/Registration/2FA){:target="_blank"} for more information.
