**Title: Matlab on HPC**

**Date: 15.12.2021**

**Topic: Focus on Parallel Programming with Matlab and using Matlab on bwUniCluster 2.0** (Web Seminar)

Lecturer: Darko Milakovic (HLRS)

Web: [https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_635&client_id=BWHPC](https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_635&client_id=BWHPC){:target="_blank"}

## Abstract

This Matlab on HPC training is a course on software development with the Matlab programming language.
The focus of the training are the essential parallel programming principles, concepts, idioms, and best practices, which enable programmers to create professional, high-quality code.
The course will give insight into the different aspects of parallelization, vectorization and optimization with Matlab and will teach guidelines to develop mature, robust, maintainable, and efficient code.
In addition, the course will give an introduction to the use of Matlab on bwUniCluster 2.0, including the batch system, workspace, module files, visualization and interactive jobs.

## Learning Sequence

- Parallel Computing with Matlab
- Using Matlab on bwUniCluster 2.0

After this course, participants will...
- understand the basic concept of parallel computing
- know about the limitations of parallel computing
- have gained knowledge about the types of parallel programming
- be able to properly write parallel code
- know about the parallelization, vectorization and optimization
- have a detailed understanding about the most important commands on the bwUniCluster 2.0

Prerequisites:
- A general knowledge of programming as well as a background in Matlab programming is useful for understanding this course.
- A basic understanding of Linux is required.
- Matlab should already be installed on the participants computer.
