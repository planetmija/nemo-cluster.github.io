The 7th bwHPC Symposium will take place this year on

**November 8, 2021**

and will be hosted at the University of Ulm.

Even though the current trends in the COVID-19 pandemic give some
hope, we will plan the symposium as an online event in order to be
able to offer all participants sufficient commitment and safety.

The event will focus on the presentation of scientific projects and
success stories carried out with the help of bwHPC high performance
computing or the BaWÃ¼ data federation, respectively. The event will
also offer a unique opportunity to engage in an active dialog between
the scientific users, operators of bwHPC services, and the bwHPC-S5
support centers.

The symposium will be free of charge and open to researchers from all
scientific fields.

Up-to-date information on registration and agenda will be coming soon
and will also be available on the symposium website:
