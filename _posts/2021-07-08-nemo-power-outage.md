There was a power outage in the morning of the 08.07.2021 (short after 7 o'clock).
All worker nodes rebooted and all running jobs were killed instantly.
Fortunately our storage for user homes and work spaces is backed up by an uninterruptible power supply so no data was lost.
The cluster is working normally again.
We will update this information when we know the reason for the outage.
