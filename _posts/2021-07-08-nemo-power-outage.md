There has been a power outage in the morning of the 08.07.2021 (shortly after 7 o'clock).
All worker nodes rebooted and all running jobs were killed instantly.
Fortunately our storages for user homes and work spaces are backed up by an uninterruptible power supply so no data was lost.
The cluster is fully operational again.

**Update 2021-07-26:**

Besides some people registering some short outages at home, as well, we haven't seen any official announcement for this problem.
