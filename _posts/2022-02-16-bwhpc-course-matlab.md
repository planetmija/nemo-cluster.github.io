The, University of Stuttgart is pleased to announce its web seminar for bwHPC users.

**Title: Matlab on HPC**

**Date: 24.03.2022**

**Topic: Focus on Parallel Programming with Matlab and using Matlab on bwUniCluster 2.0** (Web Seminar)

Lecturer: Darko Milakovic (HLRS)

Web: [https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_647&client_id=BWHPC](https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_647&client_id=BWHPC){:target="_blank"}

## Abstract

This MATLAB on HPC training is a course on software development with the MATLAB programming language.
The focus of the training are the essential parallel programming principles, concepts, idioms, and best practices, which enable programmers to create professional, high-quality code.
The course will give insight into the different aspects of parallelization, vectorization and optimization with MATLAB and will teach guidelines to develop mature, robust, maintainable, and efficient code.
In addition, the course will give an introduction to the use of MATLAB on bwUniCluster 2.0, including the batch system, workspace, module files, visualization and interactive jobs.

## Learning Sequence

- Parallel Computing with MATLAB
- Using MATLAB on bwUniCluster 2.0
- Digression: Use MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks on bwUniCluster 2.0 (Live Demo)

After this course, participants will...
- understand the basic concept of parallel computing
- know about the limitations of parallel computing
- have gained knowledge about the types of parallel programming
- be able to properly write parallel code
- know about the parallelization, vectorization and optimization
- have a detailed understanding about the most important commands on the bwUniCluster 2.0
- gained knowledge how to user MATLAB in Jupyter Notebooks

Prerequisites:
- A general knowledge of programming as well as a background in MATLAB programming is useful for understanding this course. MATLAB should already be installed on the participants computer.
- The background of Linux as well as the most important concepts and tools of Linux should be known, e.g.
    * Shell and shell commands (→safe use of the command line),
    * secure shell,
    * the handling of files and scripts,
    * the structure of the system,
    * the user and rights management and
    * creating simple batch scripts with an editor like nano, vi or emacs.
    If you still notice deficits in this respect, we refer you at this point to [https://www.tuxcademy.org/product/lxes/](https://www.tuxcademy.org/product/lxes/){:target="_blank"}.
- Experience with connecting to the bwUniCluster 2.0 as well as file systems, data transfer and using the batch system and enviroment module system on bwUniCluster 2.0, e.g., from participation in previous course "Introduction to HPC-Cluster - bwUniCluster 2.0" - [https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_664&client_id=BWHPC](https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_664&client_id=BWHPC){:target="_blank"}

## Registration and further information

- Register at bwHPC-Ilias (Learning Management System):
    - [https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_647&client_id=BWHPC](https://training.bwhpc.de/goto.php?target=crs_647&client_id=BWHPC){:target="_blank"}
- Deadline for registration: 22.03.2022, 09:00 CET
- The course language is German but slides are in English. 
- It is recommended to try the code examples yourself interactively by using your own computer with Matlab already installed.
- With a successful registration for the course, the participants get access to the content on the bwHPC-Ilias.
- The participants need to have access to the bwUniCluster 2.0, for this they need the bwUniCluster entitlement.
    - Obtainment of bwUniCluster entitlement:
