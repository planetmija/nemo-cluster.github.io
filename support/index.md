This is a general information page for all support questions around HPC.


## What to do first

Please search the relevant information on the web pages first:

- See [NEMO](/nemo/) section and the corresponding links, if you have questions regarding this topic.
- See [bwUniCluster](/bwunicluster/) section and the corresponding links, if you have questions regarding this topic.
- See [bwHPC](/bwhpc/) section and the corresponding links, if you have questions regarding **bwHPC**, **bwForCluster** and **HPC** in general.

Please try to use your work email address if it is possible. That way we can see that the requests are valid and see where you come from.

## When contacting support

Please always use the correct support unit and add the following Information when contacting support:

- Who are you (name)?
- What ist your contact (email, university email address preferred)?
  - Where are you from (university, if not specified in e-mail address).
- Who is your user at the cluster/university (username, incl. prefix e.g `fr_`)?
- Which cluster does it concern?
- If applicable: When did this happen (date and time) and where (node, e.g. login node, host, desktop pc, etc.)?

Usually the first information is given automatically, when you have configured your email client correctly.
But this info ist still necessary when you use web forms, etc.
We can find out this information ourselves, but it costs us extra time.
