## What to do first

Please search the relevant information on the web pages first:

- See general [support](/support/) information.
- Check this section and corresponding links.

## When contacting the bwUniCluster support

Besides the [general](/support/) information please try to describe your problem/question as detailled as possible.
The following steps should be considered first.

- If you start using bwUniCluster, please consider testing your job [interactively](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster_2.0_Batch_Queues#Interactive_Jobs){:target="_blank"} first.
- You can always use the [development queues](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster_2.0_Batch_Queues){:target="_blank"} to test if your job is running.
- Please debug your jobs first (see [Wiki](https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster_2.0_Slurm_common_Features){:target="_blank"} for more info on that).
  If you don't understand the output, please attach it to the support ticket.
- When using the [central ticket system](https://bw-support.scc.kit.edu/){:target="_blank"},
it is important to either select the correct support unit or even better always name the cluster you have a question about or you are experiencing the problem with.

After you have gathered all the information, please create a ticket at the [central ticket system](https://bw-support.scc.kit.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
