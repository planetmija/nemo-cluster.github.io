# bwUniCluster

The modern bwUniCluster 2.0 system consists of more than 840 SMP nodes with 64-bit Intel Xeon processors.
It provides the universities of the state of Baden-Württemberg with general compute resources and can be
used free of charge by the staff of all universities in Baden-Württemberg. Users who had access to the old
bwUniCluster will automatically also have access to bwUniCluster 2.0. There is no need to apply for new
entitlements or to re-register. 

The University of Freiburg has a share in the bwUniCluster. As such, all students and scientists of the
University of Freiburg are entitled to make use of this entry-level HPC system for their studies,
their research and their teaching activities. 
There is no need to submit a project proposal. You are competing for compute time with other users from
Freiburg by virtue of your own fairshare-value.

The bwUniCluster is a part the overall bwHPC strategy of the state of Baden-Würrtemberg for high- and
highest-performance computing in research and education. It is complemented by its sibling bwForClusters,
which offer computational resources to specific scientific communities.
